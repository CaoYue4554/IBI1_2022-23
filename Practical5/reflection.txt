This week, we start learning Python. I learnt how to launch Python on git and edit my code in nano.
Here are some problems I came across and settled:
1. In git MINGW64, type "Python" cannot launch Python, so I should type "winpty python".  
2. At first, I always forget the indents in a loop, so I made mistakes.
3. I learnt "+=" means "+" and store the result into the variable in mystery code. Then I used in the rabbit problem.
4. I am confused by "==" and "=" at first. Now I know I should use "=" when defining variables.
