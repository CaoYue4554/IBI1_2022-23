cat and mouse: score3592, 82% identical.
mouse and human: score3579, 82% identical.
cat and human: score3717, 85% identical.
Based on the score and the identities percentage, we can see that cat and human
has the most similar ACE2 protein, so they are the most closely related.

Since the similarity of a protein can partly reflect the originality and 
evolutionary distance, we can deduce that cat and human are more closely related
during evolution. On the evolution tree, mouse separated from the common ancestor 
of cat and human first. Then, after some time, human and cat separates into 
different evolutionary paths.

However, we should also be aware that the analysis above is based on only one 
protein, so it can be far from the real case.
