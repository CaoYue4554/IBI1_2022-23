I learnt how to import packages into python. First, we need to type the following code in shell:
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools #Update pip
python -m pip install matplotlib #setup matplot
After that, python can use matplotlib. But if we want to use matplotlib on pycharm, we should click file,
settings, find the right intepreter with the packages, and switch into the intepreter. After that, we click 
on the small "+" and search for matplotlib in virtual environment. Later, we download it in venv, and apply
it. Type import in coding surface, then we can use it to make the plot.
